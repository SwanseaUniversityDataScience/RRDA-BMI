### Abstract 

**Objectives** Body Mass Index (BMI) is widely used in epidemiological studies to assess disease risk associated with excess body fat and is typically documented in routinely-collected electronic health records (EHR). However, these records frequently contain substantial missing data. To address this issue, we developed a methodology to retrieve, harmonise and evaluate the completeness of BMI data from multiple linked EHR sources. 

**Methods** BMI records spanning 23 years (1st January 2000 to 31st December 2022) were retrieved from four data sources within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, encompassing the entire population of Wales, UK, across two age groups: children and young people (CYP; 2-18yo) and adults (19 years and older). We evaluated the completeness and retention of records over one, five, and 23-year period by calculating the proportion of missing data relative to each year's population. This method resulted in the creation of a harmonised, longitudinal research ready data asset (RRDA). 

**Results** We retrieved 53.4 million records for 3.4 million individuals across Wales from 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2022. Among these, 2% of CYP and 25% of adults had repeat BMI measurements recorded over periods ranging from 5 to 23 years. Throughout the entire population of Wales during this period, 49% of CYP and 26% of adults had at least one BMI reading recorded, resulting in a missingness rate of 51% for CYP and 74% for adults. Assessing BMI record preservation over one, five, and 23-year intervals from 2022 showed coverage rates of 9%, 25% and 64% respectively for CYP, and 25%, 31% and 74% respectively for adults.

**Conclusions** Our findings highlight the significant variations in BMI data availability and retention across different age groups and time periods within EHR in Wales. In conclusion, our methodology offers a reproducible and sustainable framework for extracting and harmonising BMI data. Promoting the adoption of such methods can enhance standardised approaches in utilising accessible measures like BMI to assess disease risk in population-based studies, thereby advancing public health initiatives and research efforts.

This work was supported by Health Data Research UK, which receives its funding from HDR UK Ltd (HDR-9006) funded by the UK Medical Research Council, Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council, Department of Health and Social Care (England), Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates, Health and Social Care Research and Development Division (Welsh Government), Public Health Agency (Northern Ireland), British Heart Foundation (BHF) and the Wellcome Trust. This work was supported by the ADR Wales programme of work. The ADR Wales programme of work is aligned to the priority themes as identified in the Welsh Governmentâ€™s national strategy: Prosperity for All. ADR Wales brings together data science experts at Swansea University Medical School, staff from the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD) at Cardiff University and specialist teams within the Welsh Government to develop new evidence which supports Prosperity for All by using the SAIL Databank at Swansea University, to link and analyse anonymised data. ADR Wales is part of the Economic and Social Research Council (part of UK Research and Innovation) funded ADR UK (grant ES/W012227/1).
