-- The following code is used to create the counts for the consort diagram.
-- and upset plots
-- and BMI_years worth of data


-- EXTRACTING ENTRIES FROM DATA SOURCES
-- Layer 1.1. We count the number of distinct (valid) alf and total entries from each database 
-- Layer 1.2. We then exclude those alfs and entries that were
	-- a. outside the study period (dt < study start date OR dt > study end date) -- before or after the study start date
	-- b. do not have a good quality link (sts_cd NOT IN ('1', '4', '39').
-- Layer 1.3. We then count how many distinct alfs and total entries are eligible in our study
	-- dt between study_start AND study_end dates
	-- sts_cd in ('1', '4', '39')
-- Layer 1.4. We then count distinct alfs and total entries that are not related to BMI
	-- WLGP - those with Read codes outside the BMI Lookup table
	-- PEDW - those with diagnoses outside Obesity
	-- MIDS - those with no height AND weight entries
	-- NCCH - those with no height AND weight entries
-- Layer 1.5. We count the distinct alfs and total entries that are BMI related
	-- WLGP - those with Read codes from BMI Lookup table
	-- PEDW - those with diagnoses of Obesity
	-- MIDS - those with at least one height OR one weight entries
	-- NCCH - those with at least one height OR weight entries

-- PUTTING TOGETHER ENTRIES FROM DATA SOURCES IN ONE TABLE
-- Layer 2.1 Counting distinct entries from all the data sources put together (we then link this table to WDSD)
-- Layer 2.2 Removing distinct alfs and entries with no valid demographic information:
	-- invalid WOB,
	--invalid gndr_cd,
	-- died before the study start date
	-- died < 31 days after the study start date.
-- Layer 2.3 Counting the final general COMBO table.

-- BRANCHING TO ADULT COHORT
-- Layer 3.1.1 Branching to adult cohort
	-- Removing height entries that were not the most recent
	-- Removing entries that were done when ALF was not an adult (0-18)
	-- Removing entries that were from NCCH data source
-- Layer 3.1.2 Counting the distinct alf and total entries for Adult cohort
-- Layer 4.1.1 Counting entries that are flagged as inconsistent
-- Layer 4.1.2 Flagged as 1
-- Layer 4.1.3 Flagged as 3
-- Layer 4.1.4 Flagged as 2/4
-- Layer 4.1.5 Entries not flagged
-- Layer 5.1 Counting distinct alf and total entries for ADULT final output.

-- BRANCHING TO CYP COHORT
-- Layer 3.2.1 Removing entries when ALF were 0-1 and 19-100yo
-- Layer 3.2.2 Removing height and weight pairs that were > 180 days gap
-- Layer 3.2.3 Removing BMI value entries with no percentile or z-score
-- Layer 3.2.4 Counting the distinct alf and total entries for CYP cohort
-- Layer 4.2.1 Counting entries that are flagged as inconsistent
-- Layer 4.2.2 Flagged as 1
-- Layer 4.2.3 Flagged as 2
-- Layer 4.2.4 Entries not flagged
-- Layer 5.2 Counting distinct alf and total entries for CYP final output.
