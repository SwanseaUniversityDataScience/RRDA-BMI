-- This code is the first step to creating TableOne. Here we get a monthly population denominator between 2000-2022.
-- 1. Find ALFs who lived in Wales for the particular month, e.g. Jan 2000.
-- 2. Allocate whether this ALF is an adult (1) or CYP (2) in that month.
-- 3. We only keep records that have a valid ALF, valid WOB, gndr_cd (1, 2), those who were alive on that month.
	-- NOTE: When an ALF dies within that month, they will not be included in that month, 
	-- e.g. if an ALF died on the 15th Feb, we will only collect information from them until 31 January.
	-- NOTE: Each month will have a different distinct alf count as there will be deaths/movement in and out of Wales.
-- this code is divided into yearly chunks (2000-2022) which creates a long table of all the individuals in Wales with their LSOA2011 information for each month-year.
